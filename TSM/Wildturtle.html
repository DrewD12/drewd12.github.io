  <p>WildTurtle hails from Toronto, Ontario in Canada. He has previously played as the top laner for Monomaniac and subbed for Team Legion at IPL Face Off as their AP carry. He was added as the permanent AD Carry for Team SoloMid following the benching and departure of Chaox on March 25th, 2013, and as a result left Cloud 9. 2015 spring and summer split was quite shaky from Wildturtle, so he got replaced by Doublelift and joined brand new team Immortals. So far his performance has been impressive at Immortals, as they are dominating the NA LCS spring split. Their synergy has been excellent.</p>

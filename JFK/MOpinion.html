      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>In my opinion I believe that although the whole event isn't cut and dry and it's still confusing on what trully happened because of all the different propositions, I believe that the JFK assassination wasn't a Conspiracy, and that Lee Harvey Oswald did indeed work alone in the assassination. I believe this becasue although the shots taken to kill the president were difficult ones and any normal gunman couldn't make those shots, Oswald was in the millitary and did live in another country for awhile. This means that he could have learned some skills that people may not have known about and he learned the skill to take the shots that caused such and uproar in the government and the conspiracy theorists. Along with this, the formal association that was made to find out what trully happnened stated that it wasn't a conspiracy. If it were apart of the conspiracy and they were just covering it up, I still haven't seen anything that solidifies what happened if there were more than one shooter. All of the conspiracy theorists believe that other groups such as the magfia of even other places such as Cuba where involved, but noone other than Lee Harvey Oswald has been associated with the crime. Altough he wasn't able to go to court to solidify that he was or wasn't apart of it, he is still the only one to get "punished" for the assassination. </p>

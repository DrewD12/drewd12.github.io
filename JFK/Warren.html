      <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Once the nearly year long investigating ended, they concluded that the only shooter in the JFK assassination was Lee Harvey Oswald. However, some found this report contraversal. <b>(See Afterthoughts)</b></p>

    <div id="left2">
      <h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
      <p>Altough the report was supposed to confrim to the public that this wasn't a conspiracy and allow the American public to rest and know that the 35th president was assassinated by one man who wanted to see the president dead. However, these conclusions didn't satisfy the public. Thus, conspiracy theorist still believed that the presidents assassination was not a one man job.</p>

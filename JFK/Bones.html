      <h3>Bones (cont.)</h3>
      <p>One show that made light of the conspiray of the JFK assassination was Fox's Bones. In episode 12 of season 5 the team at the Jeffersonian were delivered a body and forced to determine cause of death, however they weren't allowed to identify the body. This however didn't stop them. After seeing the skull with a large bullet hole in it, along with pink wool (which was from the coat of his wife) as well as a face reconstruction, they concluded that the body was that of the 35th president John F. Kenedy. This opened up the thought of if this was ot wasn't a conspiracy. Booth a veteran and now special agent at the FBI trusted his government and refused the possibility of it being a conspiracy. On the other hand Hodgens, a known conspricay theorist was all for it. To trully see if the events of that day were possible, the team got a replica of the gun supposedly used to shoot JFK and used it on a fake skull to see if it were possible. Booth being recognized as the best sniper in U.S. history took the rifel and proved that what Lee Harvey Oswlad was actually posible. However, Dr Brennen the head of the team did a test which concluded to her that they made a mistake and in fact the body wasn't actually JFK. <a href = "Media.html">Back to "Shows/Movies"</a></p>

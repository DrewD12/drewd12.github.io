	<h2>Study Hall</h2>
    	<p>This year in Study Hall was mostly like any other study hall, but it did have some differences. The biggest change was how the teacher didn't care that much how loud or distaracted we were, she was very lenient and it made the studdy hall more enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>Game Dev and Simulation II</h2>
    	<p>This year for Game Dev was much better than last year in the experience portion. I enjoyed being able to expand and have more time to make better games. Also, every game was made by us and wasn't some tutorial that we followed word for word. There were some down points where I didn't enjoy what we were doing but for the most part that wasn't the case. Overall, I am glad of the progress I have made and the games that I made. </p> 
    <h2>Criminology</h2>
    	<p>When I had Criminology, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would have. I went into that class becasue I had no other classes that I would have wanted to. At first I didn't see it being an easy class but in fact (for me) it was. I also liked the topics and the way the teacher teached them. It made the whole class very interesting.</p>
    <h2>CIA</h2>
    	<p>I was terrifed to have a class with Mr. Freeman, however I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he is actually really funny and sensable; he is also very good with words and the way he talks. The homework on the other hand wasn't the easiest in the world and the tests and quizes were the same, however in whole, I enjoyed that class way more than I ever thought I would have.</p>       
    <h2>Frecnh III</h2>
    	<p>This year French was harder than ever before. That was becasue the more the teacher taught the more and more I was realizing how much I didn't know and was starting to forget. So soon into the class I became very irretable and wanted the year to be over as fast as possible.</p>
    <h2>College English 11</h2>
    	<p>This class was by far the worst class I have ever taken period. At very few moments in the class did I ever enjoy it. 80% of every class was a select few boys would harass the teacher, disrupting the whole class. Along with the lackluster books that we had to read and the unamusing and unfufulling work made everything in that class miserable.</p>
    <h2>Web Design I</h2>
    	<p>This class was the definition of a rollercoaster. Half the year I loved it and enjoyed all of the websites and projects, and the other half I was nothing but stressed and looked for the easist, simplest way to just get things done. I feel that the amount of websites we had to do and how fast they were do wore me out to the point where every website was me trudging through to the end.</p>
    <h2>Preclaculus</h2>
    	<p>I can't say this was my favorite class, but It wasn't awful. I enjoyed a lot of it but getting into that kinda math really makes someone question why? Why do I need to know this? I just tried to get through a unit as little confused as possible.</p> 
    <h2>Chemisty</h2>
    	<p>Probably the easiest acedemic class I have taken this year. 90% of the year I knew exactly how to do something very early on. Near the end of the year, our teacher ended up leavng due to having a baby, and the sub made the class very pointless to me. I like her because she made it very easy, but I couldn't care as much as I did with the old teacher.</p>

<div id="footer"><a href = "http://stoningtonhigh.org"><img src = "http://coachesaid.com/Content/Mascots/ct-ctstoningtonhighschool-letter-150.png"/></a><h2>About Me</h2><p> My name is Drew Donovan and I am a student at Stonington Highschool. I am making this website as a part of a Wed Design course I am taking. The above works are all of the websites that I have made within this class. Along with Web Design I am taking Game Dev and Simulation II. I enjoy that class more because I want to go into the field of Game Development. Right now I plan on going to New England Tech, however I have gotten letters and emails from many other tech schools. I plan on going to New England Tech because it is so close to home and would mean I could stay in the town I am most comfortable in during my college carrer. As in the real of Highschool I believe I am a very good student. At this moment in time (Quarter 4, 2016) I have roughly a 4.00 GPA. As of this year however I am not enrolled in any AP, ECE or Honors classes, albeit I have been in multiple Honor clases in the past. Well that's about it, so I hope you enjoy my previous works!

  <p>He started gaming at the age of 5 with Starcraft. He wanted to be unpredictable, never wanting to do the same thing twice. This is one of the reasons he stopped playing Starcraft until Starcraft 2 came out. He never made it big in Starcraft 2 but that is when he heard of League of Legends. While playing, he met Cpt Jack and Helios. All three were eventually recruited into MiG Blaze.

On October 14th, 2015 Lustboy announced his retirement from competitive League of Legends as a player. In this announcement from TSM.gg he states his reasons: “Due to shoulder injuries and being tired of playing, I decided to step down as a player but I’ll still be involved with TSM helping in anyway possible. I will never forget how much fans and everyone treated me kindly, and I appreciate the opportunity given to me by TSM to prove my skills even though I was a foreigner.”[1]

His position as TSM's analyst in the following season means he would be highly involved in the process of creating a new roster for the team after the simulatnous departure of teammates Lucas ‘Santorin’ Larsen and Marcus 'Dyrus' Hill.</p>

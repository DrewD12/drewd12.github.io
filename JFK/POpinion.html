      <h3>Public Opinon</h3>
      <p>More than half of the population believe that the assassination of President John F. Kenedy was a conspiracy, and wasn't a solo job done by Lee Harvey Oswald. 61% of America believes this, which is the lowest it has been in the past 50 years. Only 30% of Americans stand behind the lone gunman theory.</p>

      <h3>Public Opinion (cont.)</h3>
      <p>Right after the assassination (Nov 22-27) Gallup did a study that found that only 29% of Americans thought there was only one gunman in the assassination. 52% of americans believed that the assassination was done by multiple people. In 1976 the population that believed in the conspiracy surpassed 80%.</p>

    <div id="left2">
      <h3>Involvment</h3>
      <p>Of the people who believe the Assassination of JFK wasn't done by only Oswald believe there were some other people/groups involved. The most people believe that the mafia as well as the National Governement was a part of the assassinatation. After that Americans believe that the CIA, Fidel Castro or Cuba in a whole had some part in the assassination.</p>
